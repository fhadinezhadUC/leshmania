Since the range of our clusters (positionwise!) was wide, I was not able to show them in one plot to be able to see the tRNA gene array spacing. So, I ended up showing each cluster in one plot for each genome. 
Here is three examples for genome "infantum" and two genomes that I found the best sequenced genomes from genomecomparison plot: "Trypanosoma_brucei_gambiense" and "Trypanosoma_evansi"
